        <p class="intro"><strong>Goal:</strong> Design a web site to promote a new product.</p>
        <p class="intro"><strong>Use case:</strong> Companies are constantly launching new products. Strong marketing helps these launches attain revenue growth, new customers and recognition for their achievement. You will be in charge of deciding on the type of product being sold (coffee or drink product, an app, book, etc.), the name of the product, and the content to try and share the benefits and value of that product.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Creating the brand</h2>
        <p class="text">My Daruma was the first project that I was able to design from scratch with very few guidelines. I was excited and nervous. In order to develop the design direction for this project, I started with the brand identity. Daruma dolls are not common in the United States, and I wanted to make them feel fun and approachable. After many sketches, I started building a few iterations in Illustrator. I settled on the third one because the shape would feel familiar, and it was a simple reflection of the item itself.</p>

        <h2 class="title">User Personas</h2>
        <p class="text">I didn't know anything about my target market since many Daruma dolls are sold in Japan. I began to study Twitter, Pinterest, and analytics pages for hours searching for trends. Using this research, I created two different user personas.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Building the experience</h2>
        <p class="text">Red and gold are very important colors in Asian culture. Red is also the traditional color for Daruma dolls. It signifies good fortune or luck, making it a popular color choice. Yellow represents protection and gold denotes wealth or prosperity. I echoed the Daruma doll colors in my design to create a website that complimented the product. Even the use of rounded edges throughout were selected to reflect the shape of the doll.</p>
